# GO & OneSignal API Connection

I created this **API based on the Node.js** example, since there is no **GO** related code example in the OneSignal document. When a **POST** or **GET** request comes to the service written with GO from Flutter, our service **sends a POST request to OneSignal**. I'm also listening to this in the Flutter app.[My Flutter App is here](https://github.com/endmr11/flutter-onesignal)
